## About

This repository illustrates the task of Category Prediction of an E-Commerce Website data (Flipkart), classification of the description of products into the primary categry of their category tree, and getting the notebook documenting the path to an optimal model pipeline

## Installation

 Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshiguptaaa/Flipkart_Product_Categorization/-.git
cd Flipkart_Product_Categorization/
```

** Note: The Code is Implemented in Google Colaboratory that lets us build the project without installing it locally. Installation of some libraries may take some time depending on your internet connection and system properties. You can download the Colab Notebook as a Jupyter Notebook and Run it Locally or on the Google Colab Platform as well

## Data Aquisition

You can download the E-Commerce Dataset sample from here

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pLv0fNE4WHokpJHUIs-FTVnmI9STgog05e658qEON0I/edit#gid=1396401268

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

- The dataset has 2 NA values in the Description which were Dropped
- The Product Category Tree has 337 Rows of Data that does not have a Primary Category Specified, thus they were categorised as "Others" to avoid loss of Data

**Note: Alternate approach to cleaning can be using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape the product category from the website using the Product URL 


## Data Visualization

## Approaches

#### Features Used

| Feature Name       | Type            | Description                           |
| ---                | ---             | ---                                   | 
| Description            | STR             | The description of the Product  (Primary Feature)      |
| Product_Category_Tree           | STR            | Used to Extract the Primary Category        |

#### Techniques - 

1. [Decision Tree Classification using Topic Modelling (Gensim's Latent Dirichlet Allocation Multicore algorithm )](#)
2. [Seq2Seq + Attention + Teacher Forcing Neural Machine Transaltion ( 1 Attention Layer )](#)
3. [Tuning BERT Tansformer model for Machine Translation and using BLEU Evaluation Metric](#)

## Future Scope

1. 3-5 Attention Layers in Seq2Seq Translation
2. 3-5 Attention Layers with Cross Entropy Validation in Seq2Seq Machine Transaltion
3. Ensembling the best Seq2Seq Attention model explored with the Transformer model
